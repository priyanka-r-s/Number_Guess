# Number_Guess
**Project Description**

The Number Guessing Game is a console-based Python application where the system randomly selects a number and the user tries to guess it within a limited number of attempts. The game provides feedback after each guess, calculates a score that can become negative, and ends when the user guesses correctly or exhausts the maximum number of attempts.

This project demonstrates core Python programming concepts in a simple and interactive way.
